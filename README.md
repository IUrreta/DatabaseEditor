## What's the Database Editor? ##
Basically it's just a friendly user interface that helps you make the modifications you wish for the database from your save file from F1 Manager 24 and 23!

It's developed by the same guy (me, u/ignaciourreta on Reddit) who developed multiple scripts for the F1 Manager 22 game as the driver trasnfer script, custom calendar, edit stats, or edit performance of cars

When I developed those scripts, more specifically the driver transfers script for the Script Manager for F1M22 I always had in mind to devlop a tool like this to make it easier to the user to take advantage of my scripts

### What can I actually do with the Database Editor? ###

1. Driver transfers
