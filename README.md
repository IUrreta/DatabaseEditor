## What's the Database Editor? ##
Basically it's just a friendly user interface that helps you make the modifications you wish for the database from your save file from F1 Manager 23

It's developed by the same guy (me, u/ignaciourreta on Reddit) who developed multiple scripts for the F1 Manager 22 game as the driver trasnfer script, custom calendar, edit stats, or edit performance of cars

When I developed those scripts, more specifically the driver transfers script for the Script Manager for F1M22 I always had in mind to devlop a tool like this to make it easier to the user to take advantage of my scripts

### What can I actually do with the Database Editor? ###

1. Driver transfers
2. Editing driver contracts
3. Edit driver numbers
4. Editing all staff (including drivers') stats
5. Customize your calendar, including weather of races
6. Buff or nerf any car part of any car
7. Edit the performance and durability of any of the 4 engines suppliers
8. Keep track of past seasons with a wikipedia-style table for drivers and teams championships
9. Compare drivers and teamas and their stats from their past seasons using the Head To Head graphic
10. Edit all 10 teams' facilities, money, budget available from the budget cap, plus long an short term objectives
11. Unretire drivers or change their retirement age
12. Evaluate driver's performance based on an **AI MODEL** that has been trained with the game's data to predict their positions in each race and championship.

> [!CAUTION]
> For editing the **ORDER OR NUMBER** of races it is still recommended to only do it once before the first race of the season.
> Editing the weather of races can be done whenever you want though
