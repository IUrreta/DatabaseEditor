# Database Editor for F1 Manager 23 #
Friendly to use tool for editing your save files from F1 Manager 23. Supports driver transfers, calendar customization, staff stat editing and car eprfromance editing, and from 1.6 onwards data visualization! (An area in which the game fails miserably)

If you have any issues, I recommend first look at the Troubleshoot guide for the most common error: https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Troubleshoot-guide. If this doesn't fix the error, you can open an Issue on GitHub

**KEEP IN MIND**: Since Frontier updated the game to 1.9, the save format is a bit different, so the editor will now only **RECOGNIZE SAVES FROM 1.9 ONWARDS** (not only new saves, just saves that have been loadad in the 1.9 version of the game)

## What's the Database Editor? ##
Basically it's just a friendly user interface that helps you make the modifications you wish for the database from your save file from F1 Manager 23

It's developed by the same guy (me, u/ignaciourreta on Reddit) who developed multiple scripts for the F1 Manager 22 game as the driver trasnfer script, custom calendar, edit stats, or edit performance of cars

When I developed those scripts, more specifically the driver transfers script for the Script Manager for F1M22 I always had in mind to devlop a tool like this to make it easier to the user to take advantage of my scripts

### What can I actually do with the Database Editor? ###

1. Driver transfers
2. Editing driver contracts
3. Edit driver numbers
4. Editing all staff (including drivers') stats
5. Customize your calendar (can **ONLY BE DONE** before the first race of the season)
6. Buff or nerf any car part of any car
7. Edit the performance and durability of any of the 4 engines suppliers
8. Keep track of past seasons with a wikipedia-style table
9. Compare drivers and their stats from their past seasons

## How can I install the Database Editor? ##
You'll need to downlaod two things: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

It's all covered in the [Installation and set-up guide](https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Installation-and-set%E2%80%90up-guide)

### How can I update the Database Editor if I had a previouos verision? ###

It's all explained in the [Update guide](https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Update-guide), although, from 1.4 onwards, it's as easy as clicking a button!
